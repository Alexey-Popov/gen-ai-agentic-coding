## Agent Integration Architecture

### Communication Pattern

All agents follow a standard interface:
- Input: Configuration and data to process
- Output: Results with status and metadata
- Logging: Comprehensive audit trail
- Error Handling: Graceful degradation

### Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 Agents** (Test Runner + Data Quality Validator) - Build confidence in code quality
2. **Phase 2 Agents** (Code Formatter + Documentation Generator) - Improve maintainability
3. **Phase 3 Agents** (Security Auditor + Alert Notification) - Production readiness

### Testing Strategy

Each agent should:
- Have unit tests for core functionality
- Have integration tests with the fraud detector
- Include performance benchmarks
- Log all operations for debugging

---

## Configuration

All agents are configured through:
- `config/fraud_detection.yaml` - Main configuration file
- Individual agent configs in `config/agents/`
- Environment variables for sensitive settings
