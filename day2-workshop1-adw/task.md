# Day 2 Workshop 1: AI Developer Workflows (ADWs) 

---

## Workshop Overview

Build a fraud detection transaction processing system using AI Developer Workflows. This exercise demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple AI models to support complex software development workflows.

## Learning Objectives

- Master AI Developer Workflows for banking automation
- Learn to build multi-agent systems for complex tasks
- Understand architect-editor/planning model separation

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Part 1: Code Review and Agent Selection

**Objective:** Review the fraud detection application, identify improvement opportunities, and select agents to implement.

**No code required at this stage. Only .md files.**

#### Activity 1.1: Code Review 

- Examine the provided fraud detection system in a folder *"application"*
- Understand the core functionality and architecture
- Identify areas where agents could add value
- Document observations and potential improvements

#### Activity 1.2: Agent Selection and Planning (10 minutes)

- Select 2-3 agents from available options or suggest your own
- Create specifications for each selected agent
- Document the selection rationale and expected impact
- Define integration strategy 

#### ADW Components

**Option 1 (Immediate Value):**
- **Test Runner Agent**: Automates test execution and quality checks
- **Data Quality Validator Agent**: Ensures data integrity and validation

**Option 2 (Development Support):**
- **Code Formatter Agent**: Maintains code consistency and style
- **Documentation Generator Agent**: Auto-generates and updates documentation

**Option 3 (Production Features):**
- **Security Auditor Agent**: Scans for security vulnerabilities
- **Alert Notification Agent**: Sends real-time fraud alerts

**Option 4 (Core Application Components):**
- **Data Fetcher Agent**: Retrieves and validates data
- **Analyzer Agent**: Processes and analyzes data
- **Validator Agent**: Ensures quality and compliance


#### Activity 1.3: Presentation Preparation 

Prepare a brief covering:
- Which agents were selected
- Why they were selected
- How they will be built and used
- Expected improvements to the application
- Share ideas and insights

### Part 2: Implementation and Application Improvements

**Objective:** Build the selected agents and use them to improve the fraud detection application.

#### Activity 2.1: Agent Implementation

- Build agent code following specifications from Part 1
- Implement core functionality for each selected agent
- Add integration with the original code
- Test agent functionality individually

#### Activity 2.2: Application Improvements Using Agents 

- Use implemented agents to add new features to the fraud detection system
- Apply agents to enhance existing functionality
- Demonstrate agent capabilities in a real development workflow
- Show interactions between multiple agents working together

#### Activity 2.3: Report and finalisation

**Deliverable:**
- Working agent implementations
- Enhanced fraud detection application
- Report explaining:
  - How agents were built
  - How agents were integrated
  - Improvements made to the application
  - Working demonstrations of multi-agent interaction
