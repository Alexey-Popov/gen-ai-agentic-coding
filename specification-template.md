## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Effective Prompt Structure
1. **Context**: Provide relevant background information
2. **Task**: Clearly describe what you want the AI to do
3. **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements
4. **Examples**: Include examples when helpful
5. **Output Format**: Specify the desired output format

### Banking-Specific Prompt Guidelines
- Always mention compliance requirements
- Include security considerations
- Specify data privacy requirements
- Mention audit trail needs
- Include error handling requirements
- Specify testing requirements

### Common Prompt Patterns

#### Code Generation
```
Create a [function/class] that [specific functionality] with the following requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Include proper error handling, logging, and tests.
```

#### Refactoring
```
Refactor the following code to [specific improvement] while maintaining the same functionality:
- [Current code]

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
```

#### Testing
```
Create comprehensive tests for the following [function/class]:
- [Code to test]

Test cases should include:
- [Test case 1]
- [Test case 2]
- [Edge cases]
- [Error conditions]
```

#### Documentation
```
Generate documentation for the following [function/class]:
- [Code to document]

Include:
- [Documentation requirement 1]
- [Documentation requirement 2]
- [Examples]
- [Usage instructions]
```
